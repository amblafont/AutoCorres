AutoCorres 1.6.1 (3 October 2019)
--------------
	* Correct license for a C parser file. No code changes.

AutoCorres 1.6 (5 September 2019)
--------------

	* Isabelle2019 edition of both AutoCorres and the C parser.

	* Word abstraction has been extended to C bitwise operators.

AutoCorres 1.5 (10 September 2018)
--------------

	* Isabelle2018 edition of both AutoCorres and the C parser.

AutoCorres 1.4 (2 March 2018)
--------------

        * Isabelle2017 edition of both AutoCorres and the C parser.

AutoCorres 1.3 (3 April 2017)
--------------

        * Isabelle2016-1 edition of both AutoCorres and the C parser.

        * Support for multiple two architectures: ARM (32-bit) and X64 (64-bit).
          When starting an Isabelle session with AutoCorres, the architecture
          must be selected using L4V_ARCH environment variable.

AutoCorres 1.2 (31 March 2016)
--------------

        * Isabelle2016 edition of both AutoCorres and the C parser.

        * Incompatibility: when using the “scope” option to select functions
          to translate, calls to the un-translated functions are no longer
          translated to “fail”. Instead, they call the C parser functions directly
          through a wrapper. This makes it possible to do proofs on “scope”-limited
          AutoCorres specs.

        * Several minor bug fixes and improvements.

AutoCorres 1.1 (9 Oct 2015)
--------------

        * Isabelle2015 edition of both AutoCorres and the C parser.

        * New options for changing how AutoCorres names functions and globals.

        * Incompatibility: names of global variables have changed.
          Names have changed from “lifted_globals.foo_'” to
          “lifted_globals.foo_''”. Recover the old behaviour by setting
          lifted_globals_field_suffix="_'".

        * Minor incompatibility: intermediate function names have changed.
          They are now “l1_foo'”, “l2_foo'”... instead of “l1_foo”, “l2_foo”.

        * Renamed “ccorres” predicate to “ac_corres” for clarity.


AutoCorres 1.0 (16 Dec 2014)
--------------

        * New option “no_opt” to turn off simplifier stages. (Experimental)

        * New options for tracing some of AutoCorres's internal translations.
